__What is Solara?__
Solara is a Roblox Lua script executor designed to inject custom scripts into Roblox games. It typically features a user-friendly interface, supporting easy execution of scripts through a script editor or built-in script hub.
Solara is known for its smooth performance and reliable script execution, often bypassing Roblox's anti-cheat measures to provide a range of in-game modifications.
Users can run Lua scripts to automate tasks, manipulate game mechanics, or unlock exclusive features that aren't normally available in the game. Like other Roblox executors, Solara may also include features such as:

Script library: Preloaded scripts that can be executed with a single click.

Key system: Some versions may have key authentication to manage access.

Auto-inject: Automatically injects into Roblox upon game startup.

Memory editing: Allows users to manipulate in-game values and states.

It's crucial to understand that using Solara, like any Roblox exploit, violates Roblox's terms of service and can lead to account bans or legal action.
